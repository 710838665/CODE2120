How to make a virtual environment:

- Run windows command from github desktop
- execute the following code:
mkdir venv
cd venv
python -m venv myenv

where myenv can be anything (make it short to make things more conveniant down the line)

to run your virtual environment via cmd:
	venv\myenv\scripts\activate
	cmd will have (myenv) shown at the beginning of commands now
